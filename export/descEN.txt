All types of the animations have their own type what helps us determine which animation do we want to run.
These commands run once we change the starting number. If we open Inspect in our browser the logs from
the commands can be found under the Console tab.
Example after changing the starting number to 20:
Ball, Pendulum, Car
octave/api/animation?type=ballbeam&position=0.2&newInput=[0,0,0,0]&apiKey=Strong12Key
Difference between the commands is the part after type=. In case of the balls you can see on the example
it is set to ballbeam, in case of pendulum it will be pendulum and in case of the car it will be set to car.
The number we entered to the field is saved in the position, now we set it to 20 so position=0.2.
Plane:
octave/api/animation?type=plane&position=-0.2&newInput=[0,0,0]&apiKey=Strong12Key
The plane is a little bit different since we wanted to have positive numbers when the plane is taking off
and negative numbers when going down so we needed to change them up,
that is why the 20 we filled into the field is set to -0.2 in the command.

octave/api/command?input=1%2B1&apiKey=Strong12Key
Function returns result from octave after executing the specified command that was set in the field.
In the example you can see we put 1+1 into the field and pressed Execute command. The result was ans=2.
